## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A Firebase project set up.
*   A Google AI (Gemini) API Key for Genkit functionalities.

### Environment Variables

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
2.  Add your Firebase project configuration and Gemini API key to this file. It should look like this:

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration (replace with your actual Firebase project config)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:your-app-id:web:your-web-app-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX # Optional

    # Gemini API Key for Genkit
    GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

    *   You can find your Firebase configuration in your Firebase project settings.
    *   You can get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

To run the application locally, you'll need to start two development servers:

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the frontend application on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Start the Genkit development server (for AI functionalities):**
    Open a new terminal window/tab and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This usually starts the Genkit server on `http://localhost:3400` (or as configured).
